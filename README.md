This project has been created to practice flutter clean architecture coding.

I have used [this tutorial video as reference](https://youtu.be/7V_P6dovixg?si=VvnHvaUlIqSmFcXM)

the tutorial have used [bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc) library to manage state changes. 
I replaced it with [flutter river pod](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_riverpod) for avoiding boilerplate code.
